          <h3>The State Narrative: The Inimical State</h3>
          <p>The official narrative of the Pakistani state is founded on an anti-Hindu ideology and the "Two-Nation Theory." Its core identity requires the framing of India as an existential threat. This is not a narrative of competition, but of annihilation, propagated through state-controlled education and media.</p>

          <h3>The Individual's Reality: The "Operating System" of Contempt</h3>
          <p>The on-the-ground experience for an Indian is a high probability of encountering an undercurrent of contempt and undeserved superiority, even from people who appear friendly. This is the predictable output of a 75-year state-run indoctrination program. Do not mistake cultural warmth (enjoying Bollywood, etc.) for an ideological override.</p>

          <h3>The Individual's Playbook: A Framework of Dignity</h3>
          <p>The goal is not friendship; it is to protect your professional interests and your mental peace. The core principle is: <strong>Maintain Professional Distance. Demand Professional Respect.</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>In Professional Settings:</strong> Your armor is impeccable professionalism. Be polite, be formal, and document everything. If contempt becomes discrimination, use the system (HR).</li>
            <li><strong>In Social Settings:</strong> Be friendly, but not friends. The bar for personal trust is extraordinarily high and requires extraordinary evidence that they have overcome their programming.</li>
