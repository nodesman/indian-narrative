## The Enemy Within: Why Unity is Not a Choice, But a Necessity

This section is the most difficult, and the most important, part of this entire project. It is an unflinching look in the mirror.

We, as a people of Indian origin, will compete with each other. We will have fierce debates. We will have regional, linguistic, and political differences. This is the natural order of a vibrant and diverse civilization.

But in the global arena—the digital world, the corporate world, the political world—we must recognize a fundamental truth: **we share a common interest in acting together.**

There is a strain of thought among many Indians that barks at the very idea of unity. It is a contempt for the collective, a cynical belief that this is all pointless.

Let us be clear: this attitude is a self-defeating luxury we can no longer afford.

You are not doing anyone a favor by choosing to act as a united front. You are not doing so to ensure you are not putting yourself at a permanent disadvantage.

The lived experience of countless Indians across the world has verified this time and time again: our external adversaries do not care if you are from the North or the South, if you are a Brahmin or a Dalit, if you eat meat or not. They see "an Indian," and they will apply their harmful narratives to you regardless.

Our internal divisions are a gift to those who wish us ill. Our contempt for each other is the weapon they use against all of us.

Therefore, inaction is not an option. Contempt is not an option. The pages in this section are a brutally honest diagnosis of the internal sicknesses we must cure if we are to be strong enough to win the external war.
