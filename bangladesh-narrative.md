      <h3>The State Narrative: The Contested Identity</h3>
      <p>The Bangladeshi state has two competing narratives. The official state narrative is one of secularism and friendship with India, based on the 1971 Liberation War. However, a powerful opposition narrative, rooted in Islamism, pushes an anti-India and anti-Hindu message.</p>

    <div id="reality" class="detail-content" style="display:none;">
      <h3>The Individual's Reality: The Two Narratives</h3>
      <p>An individual Bangladeshi has been exposed to both narratives. Therefore, you cannot assume goodwill. Many hold harmful beliefs about Hindus, as this is a potent political tool in their country. However, many others feel a deep sense of gratitude and cultural connection to India.</p>

    <div id="playbook" class="detail-content" style="display:none;">
      <h3>The Individual's Playbook: Initial Caution, Active Discovery</h3>
      <p>The starting point must be the same as with any potentially hostile narrative: <strong>Maintain Professional Distance. Demand Professional Respect.</strong> The difference is in the potential for a positive outcome.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Litmus Test:</strong> Actively and intelligently probe for the counter-narrative. Mentioning the shared sacrifice of 1971 or a shared cultural icon like Tagore can help you discover which narrative is dominant in the individual.</li>
        <li><strong>The Path to Friendship:</strong> If an individual consistently responds positively, you can choose to lower your guard. The potential for a friendship built on true equality is structurally higher than with a Pakistani.</li>
